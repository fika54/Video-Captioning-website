AI powered caption tool

Overview:

This project is a full stack web application that generates styled captions from an audio input and returns an mp4 video with these captions included.

The captions are generated using Whisper (https://github.com/openai/whisper).

How to run it:

Terminal 1
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt     #Advised to do this in a venv
uvicorn main:app --reload

Terminal 2
cd frontend
npm install
npm start


Features:

- Transcribes audio using OpenAi's whisper model
- segments the captions into groups of 5 to keep readability
- Word by word highlighting synced up to speech in the video
- Auto adjusted caption size based on the aspect ratio of the video
- Fade in and slide out

Potential Features:

- Separate webm download of captions to be edited into a video in a 3rd party software.
- Customised styling of the captions or style presets (Currently hardcoded to only support 1 style of caption)
- if multiple people are present speaking, identifying and showing each individual person
- manual editing of the captions in case the AI misinterprets it
- Better more developed UI
- a way to run both the frontend and backend with one command


How It Works:

1. Upload & Transcription
- User uploads a video/audio file via the frontend.
- The backend uses whisper to transcribe and time-stamp each word.

2. Styling Captions
- The backend converts segments into a ".ass" subtitle file.
- Each word is placed on either the top or bottom line (max 3 top).
- Animations like zoom and color highlight are applied per word.

3. Caption Burn-In
- FFmpeg burns the styled subtitles into the video.


Tech Stack:

- Frontend - React
- Backend - Python(with FastAPI)
- Transcription - OpenAI Whisper
- Captions - Advanced SubStation Alpha (.ass) Scripting
- Video manipulation - FFmpeg


What I learnt:

- How to levarage AI to create something complex quickly (this project took about 4 days to make while having little experience with the technologies used)

- How to debug code generated with AI

- Prompt engineering properly so AI fills gaps in my knowledge and expidites some of the coding process to make something more complex than AI could build on its own

- How Advanced SubStation Alpha (.ass) scripting works and understanding how to use it to style captions

- How to structure backend and frontend logic and link them within a full stack application
